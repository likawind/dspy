If you want to contribute to dspy, here's an overview of the codebase structure.

## Codebase Structure

### Main Directories

- **`src`**: Contains core implementations such as deployment configurations, Docker files, REST API server implementations, shared Python code, and UI implementations. It also includes the VSCode extension and Zendesk app code.
  - **`deployment`**: k8s deployment configs.
  - **`dockerfiles`**: Docker files for all containerized components. Each component's file goes to its own subdirectory.
  - **`finetune`** and **`ingestion`**: Job implementations that run inside containers.
  - **`server`**: Main REST API server implementations.
  - **`shared`**: Shared Python codes used by multiple modules.
  - **`ui`**: Main web application UI implementations.
  - **`vscode-extension`**: UI code for the VSCode extension.

- **`ui`**: Houses the main web application UI implementations, including public assets, environment variable handlers, REST API implementations, web application pages, reducers, shared components, and type definitions.
  - **`public`**: Assets to be reorganized to `src/assets`.
  - **`src`**: Main implementations.
    - **`env`**: Hooks that handle `.env` and environment variables.
    - **`handlers`**: All REST API implementations, mostly implemented in RTK.
    - **`pages`**: All web application pages and components.
    - **`reducers`**: React redux reducers for states shared across the webapp.
    - **`shared`**: App components and types shared across the webapp.

- **`shared`**: Contains shared components like data loaders, indexers, job interfaces, database models, state definitions, and constants.
  - **`data_loaders`**: Data loader interface and implementations.
  - **`indexers`**: Indexer interface and implementations.
  - **`job`**: Interface definition of job, job specs, and job runners.
  - **`models`**: Database models implemented with SQLAlchemy ORM.
  - **`state`**: Definitions for internal data structures passed across different system components.
  - **`vault`**: Vault component interface and implementations.
  - **`constants.py`**: All constants should go here.
  - **`enums.py`**: All enum definitions should go here.

### Special Considerations
- Each API implementation should go to its own file, using the `<Resource><Action><Method>` format to name files and variables.
- Avoid defining reusable types in API handler files; they should go to `src/shared/typing`.
- For more details on specific directories, refer to the respective `CONTRIBUTE.md` files in each directory.

This detailed structure will help you navigate the project more effectively and contribute efficiently.
